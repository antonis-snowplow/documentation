At Snowplow, we are always working to help teams make the most of their data. We know that discovery, comprehension of that data is very important. We noticed that in many cases, the wider team of Data Analysts, Data Scientists and Product Managers were struggling to find out exactly what is being tracked, and what the data means. 

They normally rely on tribal knowledge, so asking this information to the data team or the front end developers who instrumented the tracking.

With Snowplow Tracking Catalog all users can discover their changing data set and understand how to evolve it and use it.
