TODO
The Browser Tracker is available via `npm` and can be directly bundled into your application. It supports core tracking methods out of the box and can be extended through plugins.

The Browser Tracker is available via npm as `@snowplow/browser-tracker` and the associated plugins as `@snowplow/browser-plugin-*`.

The JavaScript Tracker supports both synchronous and asynchronous tags. We recommend the asynchronous tags in nearly all instances, as these do not slow down page load times.

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList />
```
